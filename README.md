# Hello, I’m Joseph Tate
![Me](https://github.com/joseph-a-tate/joseph-a-tate/assets/150317705/812f84d5-677e-4eef-a71c-e7d3fbfcb2dc)

### I'm interested in ... 👀
  I have a passion for backend programming. I have experience in network technology and security, servers, databases, and the code that interconnects them all. My dream is to pioneer. I love mathematics, complex systems, and a good story. A couple particular areas of interest I have unrelated to code is geopolitics and space exploration. We may just live in a time where humans will reach mars, how exciting!

### I'm currently learning ... 🌱
  The languages, concepts, and technologies I am currently studying include C, docker, project code structure, and repository platform programming for data access abstraction.

### I'm looking to collaborate on ... 💞️
  I would love to work on backend services, software, or embedded systems; anything that has IoT/Networking requirements. I would also be thrilled to learn new technologies, languages, concepts. Most excitably I hope to learn C#, ASP.NET, complex systems, and much more.
